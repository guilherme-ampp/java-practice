/**
 * The fast and slow pointers pattern uses two pointers to traverse an iterable data structure, but at different
 * speeds, often to identify patterns, detect cycles, or find specific elements.
 * <p>
 * The problem matches this pattern if the following condition is met:
 * - Linear Data Structure
 * And, if either of these conditions is fulfilled:
 * - Cycle or intersection detection
 * - Find the starting element at the second quantile (second half) - e.g. finding the middle element of an array
 * or linked list
